大家好哦.
接下来几周，需要大家共同合作完成JSP的课程设计啦。
不管大家以的编程经历如何，我相信大家都有设计出优秀程序的潜力，大家一定能设计出非常非常棒的网站的。QAQ

I think you guys must have other important jobs to do except this project.
So my plan A is to build a simple E-Commerce website to accomplish the basic requirements of the teacher.
It won't be hard because the Chapter 10 of the textbook do conclude all the codes we need to finish this task.

When the plan A is over.
Its up to you guys to do some more chanllenging jobs or not.

Anyway, have a good time~
